Problem Statement:

A leading gaming company based in San Mateo, California has been facing a lot of loss in revenue . They want to assess different aspects of their business and study the revenue contribution by each of them. They want to dive deep into the problem and answer the following questions:

Part 1: Recognizing the key revenue drivers:
What is the favorite genre in terms of playtime? What is the genre on which the users spend most?  Are these changing with time?
Do players buy games physically or digitally more? What is the spend distribution? Is it changing with time?

Part 2: Hourly Spend Ratio:
Hourly spend is defined as Spend per total playtime hour (SPH). Create meaningful SPH buckets after creating this SPH variable. Do it using a DAX query.
Answer questions of Part 1  for each of these SPH buckets. Do we see a trend across these buckets?

Part 3: ROI Generation:
What is the overall ROI?
What is the distribution of accounts who have resulted in
Positive ROI
Break-Even
Negative ROI

Part 4: Segment Creation:
Distribute players based on playtime and revenue into 2x2 matrix to classify players into low and high segments of playtime and revenue.
The above distribution should have different filters to slice the matrix further, and then specific segments of users with high Hourly Spend Ratio should be identified in the insight
